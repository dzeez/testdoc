# Publish your project via GitHub Pages

In order to get a live, working URL for your project (free web hosting), follow these instructions.

Go to GitHub.com, and find your Unit 3 project repository. Open it up, and click on the Settings tab (with gear icon) near the top, towards the right.

Click "Pages" on the left navigation.

Under "Branch," click the "None" dropdown and select the main branch, and click Save.

That's really all, though it can take a few minutes for everything to begin working.

Only thing left is to find the URL for the site. Go back to the main page of the repository, and look on the right side to see if it says github-pages. Click it, it will open a new tab. There should be a blue, underlined URL in a box near the top. That's your publicly accessible web address. 

If you copy the URL and paste it into the form (coming soon), I will collect all the projects and set up a page with links to all of them.

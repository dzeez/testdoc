# How to commit your project to GitHub

If you have not already, please go to Replit, open your Unit 3 project, go to the bottom left Tools list, and click on "Git."


Then, on the right, enter a description (eg "add finishing touch"), then click the big orange bottom button "Stage and commit all changes."

Then click "Sync with remote." Click "Confirm for this sesion" in the dialog box that appears asking you to pass GitHub credentials.

[!NOTE]
It is possible that you will encounter errors relating to GitHub credentials. If so, send me an email.
